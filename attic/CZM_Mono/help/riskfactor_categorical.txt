Categorical Risk Factor Configuration

For the selected categorical risk factor, enter the names for the different classes (either manually or via import).

Save the results ("Save") and close the window ("cancel")

The names identify the each risk factor class clearly. An example is "normal weight", "overweight", and "obese" for BMI. Also combined classes can be specified (e.g. "normal weight and smoker", "normal weight and non-smoker" etc.). 

The type of risk factor class (either "categorical", "continous", or "compound") and the number of categorical risk factor classes (up to 10) can be specified in "Create Risk Factor Type" ("Startscreen"). 

The number of categorical risk factors depends on scientific considerations and availability of data.
