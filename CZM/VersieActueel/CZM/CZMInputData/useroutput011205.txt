COMMENTS ON OUTPUT VARIABLES

	here the variables are selected of which table or graphic results are presented:

	variables calculated by CDM in each 1-year time step (see also marginalmodelresults)

		total population numbers
		(discrete) risk factor class prevalence figures
		(continuous) risk factor distribition characteristics
		disease prevalence figures
		disease incidence figures
		mortality figures
		age at disease onset
		time since smoking cessation

	variables that are calculated afterwards

		life-expectancy and costs figures

COMMENTS ON SPECIFICATION OF OUTPUT

	rates	0	absolute numbers
		1	rates: absolute numbers / total population numbers

	scaled	0	not
		1	rates: calculated time-dependent absolute numbers / initial absolute number

	age specification (0,1,2,3)

			risk factor class prevalence numbers		disease prevalence numbers
	
		0	aggregated over age				aggregated over age
		1	idem, stacked over risk factor classes		idem
		2	specified by 5-year age class			specified by 5-year age class
		3	see 2, stacked over risk factor classes		stacked over 5-year age classes

	within disease population (0,1)

		if 1, risk factor class prevalence figures are presented stratified by each disease selected

COMMENTS ON COMBINING OF LIFE YEARS

	cumulative	0	yearly numbers
			1	cumulative over time
	discountc 	>=0	disounting factor of costs
	discounte 	>=0	discounting factor of effects
	disweighting 	0	no weighting of population numbers (default setting)
			1	disease-free numbers
			2	DALY-weighting assuming proportionality of weights
			3	DALY-weighting assuming additivity of weights
			4	DALY-weighting based on worst disease
	otherdis	0	no costs or effects of other diseases included (1 yes)
	heterogeneity	0	co-morbidity prevalence rates not taking into account population heterogeneity (1 yes)
