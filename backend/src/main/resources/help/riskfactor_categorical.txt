Enter the names for the different risk factor classes.
The names identify the each risk factor class clearly (e.g.normal weight", "overweight", and "obese" for BMI). The type of risk factor class (either "categorical", "continuous", or "compound") and the number of categorical risk factor classes (up to 10) can be specified in "Create Risk Factor Type" ("Startscreen").
