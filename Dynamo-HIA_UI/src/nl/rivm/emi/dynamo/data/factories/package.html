This package contains the factories that create the different types of configuration objects 
from scratch or from an XML configuration file.<br/>
The Classes having names starting with "Agnostic" cannot be used on their own, they are wrapped 
by the other factories, providing a working factory implementation.<br/>  
For creating an initial configuration object containing default values each factory 
implementation contains a template of the configuration object it is supposed to build. The 
atomic types contained in this template contain information that controls the structure that
is made and the default value (or value range) the element(s) will have.
