When an XML file is found in the tree the collection of schemas incorporated 
in Dynamo-HIA is used at a low level to decide whether it is a valid 
configuration file. When this is the case and the user opens it through the 
context menu attached to it the name of the rootelement is used to find the 
factory to use for the construction of the corresponding configuration object.<br/>
For configurations containing elements with different names below the root element 
a similar mechanism is used to find the factory on a per rootchild basis.<br/>
This package contains the Classes that support the finding of both kinds of factories.
