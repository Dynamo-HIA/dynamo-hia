Population Size

For the selected population, enter the population size by sex and age class (either manually or via import).  

Files of this format can be created using the "Population size(Jan,1)" worksheet in the "macro/1-Population/Population.xml" workbook.

Save the results ("Save") and close the window ("cancel").

The population size is an absolute number (e.g. the actual number of people) for every age and sex category.

Sources for the population size are for example Eurostat or other national statistical offices.
