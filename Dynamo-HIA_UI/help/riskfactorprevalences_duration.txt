Prevalence within the duration depended risk factor class. For a given age (the column), enter the share of people in duration since entering this class (the top row in years). Each row has to add up to 100. 
Not everybody in the population has to be in the duration depended class, only a fraction might be exposed (see Prevalence for Compounding risk factor).
