For the selected continuous risk factor, enter the relative risk on total mortality by age and sex (either manually or via import). 

Files of this format can be created using the "Rel risk for death_Contin" worksheet in the "macro/7-Relative risk for riskfactor continuous/Relative risk for riskfactor continuous.xml" workbook.
 
This captures the increased mortality of exposure to a risk factor in general and not just via the modelled diseases. An example is smoking which not only leads to, say, lung cancer but increase mortality through a number of other diseases which are not specifically modeled. 

Sources for the relative risk on overall mortality are the scientific literature.
