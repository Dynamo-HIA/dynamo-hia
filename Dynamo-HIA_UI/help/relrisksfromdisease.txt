Relative Risks from other Diseases

For the selected disease, enter relative risk of obtaining the selected disease when having another (intermediate) disease for each sex and age class (either manually or via import). The intermediate disease has to be specified before creating this window. 

Files of this format can be created using the "Rel risk from other diseas_Cat" worksheet in the "macro/9-Relative risk from other disease/Relative risk from other disease.xml" workbook.
 
Save the results ("Save") and close the window ("cancel").

The risk of contracting a disease can be increased when already having another, intermediate disease. Not every disease has an intermediate disease or acts an intermediate disease.

An example for an intermediate disease is diabetes, which increases the risk of contracting cardiovascular diseases. 

Sources for the relative risks from other diseases rates are the scientific literature.
