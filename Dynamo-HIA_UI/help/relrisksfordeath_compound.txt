For the selected compounding risk factor, enter the relative risk on total mortality for each age, sex, and risk factor class (either manually or via import).

For compounding risk factor, in one risk factor class the relative risk depends on duration of membership. This is defined by a function where “begin” is the relative risk in the first year and “end” the relative risk in the last year”. The value for “alpha” gives the speed at which the relative risk increases with duration of membership. 

Files of this format can be created using the "rr for death compound" worksheet in the "macro/8-Relative risk for riskfactor compound/Relative risk for riskfactor compound.xml" workbook.

This captures the increased mortality of exposure to a risk factor in general and not just via the modelled diseases. An example is smoking which not only leads to, say, lung cancer but increase mortality through a number of other diseases which are not specifically modeled. 

Sources for the relative risk on overall mortality are the scientific literature.
