Odds ratio on disability for a compound risk factor. This is defined by a function where “begin” is the relative risk in the first year and “end” the relative risk in the last year. The value for “alpha” gives the speed at which the relative risk changes with duration of membership. This captures the increased risk of disability through the exposure to a risk factor in general and not just via the modelled diseases.
