Excess Mortality

For the selected disease, enter the excess mortality for each sex and age class (either manually or via import). This can be done either by choosing "Rate" or "Median Survival". "Acutely Fatal" and "Cured Fraction" can always be entered.

Excess Mortality as a Rate, sometimes called "case fatality rate", is the difference in mortality rate between those with the disease and those without the disease.

Excess Mortality as a Median Survival Time is defined as the number of years from the onset of the disease at which half of the diseased are expected to be still alive.

The Acutely Fatal is the percentage of the people that dies immediately of the disease while in others it leads to chronic conditions with increased mortality. 

The Cured Fraction is the percentage of patients that is cured, e.g. has a zero excess mortality.

The median survival time in combination with cured fraction is most appropriate for cancers. Or other diseases where the excess mortality slowly declines over years until it is zero long after the diagnosis.


Sources for excess mortalities are scientific literature or can be obtained by using DISMOD.
