Files of this format can be created using the "Relative risk for riskfactor_Cat" worksheet in the "macro/6-Relative risk for riskfactor cat/Relative risk for riskfactor cat.xml" workbook.

The risk of contracting a disease depends on the degree of exposure to a given risk factor. It usually, but not necessarily increases with higher risk factor classes. 

Sources for the relative risks from other diseases rates are the scientific literature.
