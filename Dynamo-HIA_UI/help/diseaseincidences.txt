Disease Incidence

For the selected disease, enter the disease incidence for each sex and age class (either manually or via import). 

Files of this format can be created using the "Disease incidence" worksheet in the "macro/2-Disease/Disease.xml" workbook.

The incidence rate is defined as the number of new cases of the selected disease per xxx person-years in those without the disease. 

Sources for incidence rates are the scientific literature.
