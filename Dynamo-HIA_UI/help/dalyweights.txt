For the selected disease, enter DALY-Weights for each sex and age class (either manually or via import)

Files of this format can be created using the "DALY weights for disease" worksheet in the "macro/2-Disease/Disease.xml" workbook.

DALY (disability adjusted life years), sometimes called health state valuations, are measures of disease severity. A value of xxx means no impairment through disease, a value of xxx means a health state as worse death. 
 
To calculate population summary measures, such as disability adjusted life years, the prevalence of the disease is multiplied by the entered DALY-weight. See also “Overall DALY-weights” under “population”.
