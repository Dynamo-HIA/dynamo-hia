DALY (disability adjusted life years), sometimes called health state valuations, are measures of disease severity. A value of zero means no impairment through disease, a value of 100 means a health state as worse death. To calculate population summary measures,  the prevalence of the disease is multiplied by the entered DALY-weight.
