DALY (disability adjusted life years) are measures of disease severity: 0 means no impairment through disease, a value of 100 means a health state as worse as death. 
Overall DALY-weights are needed as just providing disease specific DALY weights would lead to underestimation as only a limited number of diseases that cause disabilities are modeled. 
Import-ready xml-files for this window can be created using the "Overall daly weights" worksheet in the Excel-file "Populations.xls".
