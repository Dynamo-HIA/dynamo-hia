DALY (disability adjusted life years) are measures of disease severity: 0 means no impairment through disease, a value of 100 means a health state as worse as death. 
Overall DALY-weights are needed as only providing disease specific DALY weights would lead to underestimation as only a limited number of diseases that cause disabilities are modeled. 

Files of this format can be created using the "Overall daly weights" worksheet in the "macro/1-Population/Population.xml" workbook.
