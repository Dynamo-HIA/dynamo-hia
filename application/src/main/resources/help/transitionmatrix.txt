For the selected categorical risk factor, enter the probability of moving from one risk factor class to another risk factor by age and sex. The button “Apply current sheet to all higher ages” assigns the current values to all older age groups.
An example is the transition from class 1 (“never-smoker”) to class 2 (“smoker”); not all possible transition are plausible (e.g. from “smoker” to “non-smoker”) and should be set to zero. 
Import-ready xml-files for this window can be created using the "transition matrix" worksheet in the Excel-file "Risk factor categorical.xls".
