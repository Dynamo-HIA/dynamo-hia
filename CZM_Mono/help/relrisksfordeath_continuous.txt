                                     Relative Risk for Death from Continuous Risk Factor
For the selected continuous risk factor, enter the relative risk on total mortality by age and sex (either manually or via import). 

Save the results ("Save") and close the window ("cancel").

This captures the increased mortality of exposure to a risk factor in general and not just via the modelled diseases. An example is smoking which not only leads to, say, lung cancer but increase mortality through a number of other diseases which are not specifically modeled. 

Sources for the relative risk on overall mortality are the scientific literature.
