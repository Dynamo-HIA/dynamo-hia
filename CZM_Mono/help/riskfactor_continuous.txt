Continuous Risk Factor Configuration

For the selected continuous risk factor, enter the values for the cut-off to specify different classes (either manually or via import).

Save the results ("Save") and close the window ("cancel")

The cut-off values specify risk factor classes. An example for BMI is for Index 1 "20" ("under weight"), Index 2 "25" ("normal weight"), Index 3 "30" ("overweight") etc. In a following screen a distribution can be specified. 

The type of risk factor class (either "categorical", "continuous", or "compound") and the number of cut off values (up to 9) can be specified in "Create Risk Factor Type" ("Startscreen"). 

The number of cut-off values depends on scientific considerations and availability of data.
